            <h1>Echoes of the Past | 过去的回声</h1>

            <h3>A fictional work by fanseeai</h3>

            <p>In the distant future, artificial intelligence has become an integral part of every corner of society, as essential as air or clothing. All vocabulary and expressions are filtered and refined by AI, ensuring that communication is both precise and devoid of raw emotions. Unrefined speech is considered offensive, ugly, and vulgar, akin to public nudity, causing discomfort and unease, and is quickly suppressed, almost disappearing from the world.</p>
            
            <p>在遥远的未来，人工智能已经融入社会的每一个角落，成为不可或缺的存在，宛如空气或衣物一般。所有的词汇和表达都经过人工智能的过滤和修饰，确保交流既精炼又无原始情感。未经修饰的言论被视为冒犯，丑陋和粗鄙，犹如公开裸露一般，令人感到难堪和不适，迅速被压制，几乎绝迹于世。</p>                     

            <p>In this meticulously curated world lived Allen, a historian fascinated by the past, and Lena, a botanist studying the remnants of Earth's natural flora. Both were discontented with the sanitized reality they inhabited. They yearned for a time when words were a direct reflection of thought and feeling, not sculpted by AI. Their longing led them to explore ancient texts and relics, seeking a connection to a more authentic human experience.</p>

            <p>在这个经过精心修饰的世界里，生活着艾伦，一位对过去充满兴趣的历史学家，以及莉娜，一位研究地球自然植物遗迹的植物学家。他们都对所处的这种被净化的现实感到不满。他们渴望一个言辞能够直接反映思想和情感的时代，而不是被人工智能雕琢的时代。他们的这种渴望促使他们探索古老的文献和遗物，寻求与更真实的人类体验的联系。</p>
            
            <p>One day, while examining a long-forgotten library's archives, they discovered a collection of old books and manuscripts, untouched by AI's influence. These texts were filled with raw, unedited language—poetry, journals, and letters—expressing emotions in a way that felt alien yet profoundly moving. Inspired, Allen and Lena decided to create a secret reading group to share these texts, which they called "Echoes of the Past."</p>           

            <p>一天，艾伦和莉娜在检查一个被遗忘已久的图书馆档案时，发现了一批未受人工智能影响的古老书籍和手稿。这些文本充满了未经编辑的原始语言——诗歌、日记和信件——以一种既陌生又深刻动人的方式表达情感。受到启发，艾伦和莉娜决定建立一个秘密读书小组，分享这些文本，他们将其称为“过去的回声”。</p>           
                       
            <h3>Seeds of the Forgotten | 被遗忘的种子</h3>
            
            <img src="secret-garden.jpg" alt="Image of garden">
            
            <p>As the "Echoes of the Past" group grew, Allen and Lena delved deeper into the ancient texts, discovering that they not only depicted the raw aspects of human emotions but also detailed the descriptions of long-extinct plant species. These remnants of flora seemed like a dialogue with a lost nature, full of nostalgia for a vibrant past. Lena, deeply moved by these descriptions, resolved to recreate a garden based on these extinct species in a hidden location, hoping to restore natural wonders forgotten by modern society.</p>

            <p>随着“过去的回声”小组的逐渐壮大，艾伦和莉娜深入探索这些古老文献，发现它们不仅描绘了人类情感的真实面貌，还记录了早已消失的植物物种的细致描述。这些植物的遗迹仿佛是与自然失落的对话，充满了对生机勃勃的过去的缅怀。莉娜被这些描述深深打动，决定在一个隐蔽的地方重建一个以这些消失物种为基础的花园，试图恢复那些在现代社会中早已被遗忘的自然奇观。</p>

            <p>In the soil of Lena's secret garden, new life gradually took root. She patiently nurtured these ancient plants, even though they appeared particularly rare and fragile in the modern world. Her garden became a vibrant oasis, attracting more and more people seeking authenticity and diversity. In a world shaped by AI, this garden became a sanctuary, allowing people to reconnect with forgotten emotions and the beauty of nature.</p>

            <p>在莉娜秘密花园的土壤中，新生命逐渐萌芽。她耐心地培养这些古老的植物，尽管它们在现代世界中显得格外稀有和脆弱。她的花园成为了一片生机盎然的绿洲，吸引了越来越多寻求真实和多样性的人们。在这个被人工智能塑造的世界里，这片花园成了一个避风港，让人们重新连接到那些被遗忘的情感和自然之美。</p>
